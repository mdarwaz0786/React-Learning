// Thinking in React:
// Thinking in React is a concept that guides developers on how to approach building user interfaces using React's component-based architecture.

// Here are the key steps involved in Thinking in React:
// 1.Break Down the UI into Components:
// Start by breaking down the UI into distinct, self-contained components. Each component should have a single responsibility and represent a part of the user interface.

// 2.Build a Static Version:
// Before focusing on interactivity, create a static version of your UI using hardcoded data (props). This helps you establish the component hierarchy and understand the structure of your app.

// 3.Identify the Minimal State:
// Determine the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. State should be identified based on what needs to change and be updated over time.

// 4.Determine State Ownership:
// Decide which component should own and manage the state. Typically, this is the highest common ancestor that needs access to the state data.
// Pass Props: Establish the flow of data by passing props from parent components to child components. This propagates data from top to bottom in your component hierarchy.

// 5.Design an Interactive UI:
// Once you have a static version and data flow in place, start adding interactivity. Introduce event handlers, update state, and propagate changes through props.

// 6.Lift State Up (if needed):
// If multiple components need access to the same state or need to share state changes, consider lifting the state to a common ancestor component.

// 7.Think in Reusable Components:
// As you iterate and build your UI, aim to create reusable components. Components should be modular and flexible enough to be reused across different parts of your app.

// 8.Test Thoroughly:
// Continuously test your components and UI for various scenarios. Make sure each component works as intended and responds correctly to different user interactions.

// 9.Optimize for Performance:
// Profile and optimize your app's performance as needed. Use tools like React's built-in performance tools or third-party libraries to ensure your app is responsive and efficient.

// Note:
// Remember that Thinking in React is not a strict set of rules but rather a methodology that can help guide your thought process as you design and build React applications.
